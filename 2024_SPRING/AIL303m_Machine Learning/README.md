# Introduction to Machine Learning

The course provides an introduction to: 

• Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning: common techniques to retrieve your data, clean it, apply feature engineering, and have it ready for preliminary analysis and hypothesis testing.

• Supervised Machine Learning: how to train models to predict outcomes and how to use error metrics to compare across different supervised models.

• Unsupervised Machine Learning: how to find insights from data sets that do not have a target or labeled variable. Learners will learn several clustering and dimension reduction algorithms for unsupervised learning as well as how to select the algorithm that best suits your data.
