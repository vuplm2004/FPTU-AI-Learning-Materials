# Mathematics for Machine Learning

This is one of the most, if not the most important subject for AI-major students to study in the curriculum.

This course introduces the mathematical concepts and foundations needed to talk about the three main components of a machine learning system: data, models, and learning. Upon this course, students will be able to understand: 

• Foundametal concepts about matrices and matrix decomposition.

• Concepts of gradients.

• The basics of probability and some distributions.

• Optimization to find maxima/minima of functions. 

• Dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis.

• Classification in the context of support vector machines.


## Video Lectures

This subject is highly mathematical so my teacher used chalks and board for lecturing. To revise the knowledge, students should have slides or recorded video,  so I have some suggestions down below:

### Youtube Playlists
