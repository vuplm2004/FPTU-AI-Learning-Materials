Question 3: (2 marks)
In this question you should complete some methods in Graph.py file. 

 The class Graph is the implementation of a graph. The following methods should be completed: 
	void f1() - Perfom depth-first traversal from the vertex i=1 (the vertex B) but display vertices with their degrees are even number in bracket. Hint: copy depthFirst(…) and depth(...) to  depthFirst2(…) depth2(...) and modify them. Output in this case like that:
OUTPUT
B C H D G A E F I 
B C(2) H(2) D(2) G(2) A(4) E F I 
FINISH

	void f2() – Supposed the given graph has Euler's cycle. Apply the pseudocode in the Graph.py file to write statements to find the Euler's cycle from the vertex 1 (B). Display vertices with their degrees are greater than 2 in bracket. Outpt in this case like that:
OUTPUT
B(4) D(4) E(4) D(4) C B(4) E(4) G(4) A(4) G(4) F A(4) B(4)
FINISH
