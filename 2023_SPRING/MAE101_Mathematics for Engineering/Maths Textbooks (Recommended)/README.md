# My Recommendation on Maths Textbooks

The learning materials for Maths in FPTU is on base-level, especially the slides so you must read the textbooks. Personally, my uni's textbooks does not suit me, so I will recommend my favorites.

### Calculus

### Linear Algebra
Linear Algebra and its applications by  Gilbert Strang: https://amzn.to/3NfoRgN
